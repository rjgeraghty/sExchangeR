# 
# Simple Exchange Reporting 
# (and monitoring)
#
# Motivation: 
# - Relevant. I'm working a multi-domain o365 hybrid migration for some international brands   
# - Novelty. I've used MacOS/Linux/Bash et al almost exlusively for over 15 years
# - ADHD. The struggle is real.
# - Powershell. It's nice.
# - Git. Use more, forget less
